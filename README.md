Sure thing! Here’s a clean and straight-to-the-point `README.md` that fits the vibe:

# Discord Server Creation Date Checker 🔍

Ever got kicked from a server and wondered *"When was that server even created?"*  
This little script reveals the **creation date** of any Discord server (or user/message/etc.) using its **Snowflake ID**.

## 🧠 How It Works

Discord IDs (called *Snowflakes*) actually contain a timestamp.  
This script decodes that timestamp and tells you **exactly when the server (or whatever) was born.**

## 🛠 Usage

1. Grab the server ID (or any Snowflake).
   - Right-click a server (or user/message) > Copy ID
   - Make sure **Developer Mode** is on in Discord settings!

2. Edit the script:

```python
# Replace this line:
guild_id = "insert id here"
# With your actual ID:
guild_id = 123456789012345678
```

3. Run it:

```bash
python snowflake_date.py
```

4. Get the creation date in UTC.

## 🧪 Example Output

```
ID 123456789012345678 was created on 2017-05-14 18:27:36.123000 UTC
```

## 📦 Requirements

Just Python. No installs, no dependencies.  
It’s that lightweight.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This won’t work if you enter a fake or random ID.  
Discord snowflakes are structured — you need a **real** one for it to spit out a valid date.

Made for curious Discord users and those kicked from servers who just *need to know*.
